## Concept of the Website
Researching fiber optic cables and how they have impacted the growth of the internet across the world. Possibly using this website as a platform to show how a fiber optic cable can use the connection of the internet to connect different cultures around the world. I can learn about any culture I want to with the power of the internet. Before the internet this was much harder and would most likely not be able to happen at the drop of a hat in your home, car, etc.
