## Concept of the Website
Researching fiber optic cables and how they have impacted the growth of the internet across the world. Possibly using this website as a platform to show how a fiber optic cable can use the connection of the internet to connect different cultures around the world. I can learn about any culture I want to with the power of the internet. Before the internet this was much harder and would most likely not be able to happen at the drop of a hat in your home, car, etc.

## Website General Info

### Description
Impact fiber optic cables had on technology, history, culture relating to the history and technology of the internet. This is not limited to making connections within companies who helped create and implement the use of fiber optic cables to connect the world.

## Page 2

How fiber optic cables are run across the ocean floors, and how this could impact us environmentally. Environmental factors were taken into consideration when connecting the world with these cables. This page would contain how exactly the cables were ran throughout the world, how companies fund or what type of impact they may have on this growth of communication/hand in the internet.

## Footer Menu

The footer menu would include big tech links that have a hand in fiber optic's communication and technology.

## About Page

This page would give a basic description about why this webpage is needed to create knowledge and awareness for environmental concerns, as well as teaching the history and hand that large corporations have in this type of communications.
